# Blockchain Frontend

A modern React frontend for interacting with the blockchain network, built with Vite, Tailwind CSS, and shadcn/ui components.

## Features

- **Blockchain Explorer**: View all blocks in the chain with detailed information
- **Wallet Management**: Create and manage blockchain wallets, check balances with faucet support
- **Transaction Manager**: Send transactions with payload support
- **Mining Interface**: Mine new blocks with configurable transaction limits and earn mining rewards
- **Mempool Viewer**: Monitor transactions waiting to be mined, sorted by fees or age
- **Network Management**: Add nodes, initialize network, view network status
- **Blockchain Validation**: Validate the entire blockchain integrity
- **Real-time Updates**: Auto-refresh data and consensus synchronization

## Backend Integration

This frontend is perfectly synchronized with the backend API and supports all backend features:

- ✅ Transaction broadcasting with ID and payload support
- ✅ Mining with transaction limits (1-100 transactions per block)
- ✅ Mempool sorting by fees and age
- ✅ Network node management and automatic initialization
- ✅ Blockchain validation endpoint
- ✅ Wallet creation with private key management
- ✅ Faucet functionality for test coins
- ✅ Consensus mechanism for multi-node sync
- ✅ Real-time mempool and blockchain updates

## Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16 or higher)
- A running blockchain backend node (see backend README)

## Installation

1. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

2. Configure the backend API URL:
   - Update `VITE_API_BASE_URL` in `.env`
   - Default: `http://localhost:3001`

## Development

Start the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:5173`

## Build for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

## Usage Guide

### 1. Overview Tab

- View blockchain statistics (chain length, transactions, pending, network nodes)
- Validate blockchain integrity with one click
- See latest block information
- Auto-updates with network changes

### 2. Blocks Tab

- View all blocks in the blockchain (newest first)
- See block details: hash, previous hash, nonce, timestamp
- View all transactions within each block
- Identify mining reward transactions

### 3. Wallets Tab

- Create new wallets (generates public/private key pairs)
- View wallet balances
- Use faucet to get test coins (100 coins default)
- Select active wallet for transactions

### 4. Transactions Tab

- Send transactions to other wallets
- Include optional payload data
- Set custom transaction fees
- Transaction IDs are automatically generated

### 5. Mining Tab

- Select wallet to receive mining rewards
- Set transaction limit (1-100 transactions per block)
- Mine blocks with automatic network synchronization
- View mining progress and results

### 6. Mempool Tab

- View all pending transactions
- Sort transactions by:
  - Default order
  - Highest fees first
  - Oldest transactions first
- See transaction fees, amounts, and payloads
- Real-time updates every 5 seconds

### 7. Network Tab

- View all network nodes and their status
- Add new nodes to the network
- Initialize network with default nodes (ports 3001-3004)
- Network auto-discovery and setup on startup

## Backend Compatibility

The frontend matches the backend perfectly with these key features:

### Transaction Management

- **UUIDs**: Every transaction has a unique ID generated by the backend
- **Payload Support**: Send additional data with transactions
- **Fee System**: Set custom fees for transaction priority
- **Digital Signatures**: Transactions are cryptographically signed

### Mining Features

- **Transaction Limits**: Choose how many transactions to include (backend supports 1-100)
- **Mining Rewards**: Configurable mining reward (default: 100 coins)
- **Difficulty System**: Automatic difficulty adjustment
- **Block Broadcasting**: Mined blocks are automatically shared with network

### Network Features

- **Multi-node Support**: Connect to multiple blockchain nodes
- **Automatic Registration**: Nodes register with each other automatically
- **Consensus Algorithm**: Longest valid chain rule
- **Network Initialization**: One-click setup for predefined node network

### Mempool Features

- **Fee-based Sorting**: Transactions sorted by fee for mining priority
- **Age-based Sorting**: View oldest transactions first
- **Real-time Updates**: Mempool refreshes automatically
- **Transaction Removal**: Mined transactions are removed from mempool

## Technical Details

### Architecture

- **React 18** with hooks and context
- **TypeScript** for type safety
- **Tailwind CSS** for styling
- **shadcn/ui** components
- **Lucide React** icons
- **Vite** for fast development

### API Integration

- RESTful API client with error handling
- Automatic retry mechanisms
- Real-time data synchronization
- Background consensus updates

### Error Handling

- Comprehensive error boundaries
- Network error detection
- User-friendly error messages
- Automatic recovery suggestions

## Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file:

```env
VITE_API_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3001
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Backend Not Running**
   - Ensure blockchain backend is running on the configured port
   - Check network connectivity
   - Verify CORS is enabled on backend

2. **No Network Nodes**
   - Use the "Quick Setup" button in Network tab
   - Manually add nodes or initialize network
   - Ensure multiple backend nodes are running

3. **Transactions Not Mining**
   - Check if any nodes are mining
   - Verify wallet has sufficient balance
   - Ensure mempool has transactions to mine

4. **Validation Errors**
   - Run consensus to sync with network
   - Check for corrupted blocks
   - Restart nodes if needed

## Development Notes

The frontend automatically:

- Runs consensus every 30 seconds
- Refreshes mempool every 5 seconds
- Updates network status every 30 seconds
- Validates API responses
- Handles network timeouts gracefully

This ensures the UI stays synchronized with the distributed blockchain network.
